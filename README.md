# Crop-Classification-Supervised-and-Unsupervised
All the python code files are available here

The files are divided into 2 sections, supervised and unsupervised

Supervised, covers classification of crops based on Machine Learning and Deep Learning concepts,

Unsupervised, covers classification of crops based on clustering algorithm.

Inpur data files contains multi band raster images taken using Sentinel - 2 satellite data source.
